# hxdmp
## Overview
`hxdmp` is a Rust version of `hexdump -C`, i.e. outputs are similar if both commands are run on the same file (demonstrated by `./tools/test.sh`). This program was written as an exercise to duplicate `hexdump(1)`. No other options of `hexdump(1)` are implement but that could be done pretty easily.
